Case Study: Hardcoded Cryptographic Key Exposing PII in Client-Side Application

Overview

While testing a large Indian consumer-facing media platform, I identified a
*client-side cryptographic design flaw* where sensitive user information
was encrypted using a **hardcoded symmetric key embedded in public JavaScript**.

Although the issue was later marked as a duplicate by the organization,
this case study documents the technical finding and security reasoning.

Vulnerability Type

- Use of Hardcoded Cryptographic Key
- Client-Side Decryption of Sensitive Data
- PII Exposure Risk

CWE: CWE-321 – Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key  
OWASP Top 10: A02 – Cryptographic Failures

 Discovery Method

- Manual inspection of client-side JavaScript bundles
- Review of authentication and OTP-related flows
- Analysis of browser storage (localStorage)

No automation or exploitation at scale was performed.

Technical Summary (Sanitised)

- Sensitive user data (mobile number) was encrypted and sent to the client
- The encryption key was **statically embedded** inside a public JavaScript file
- Anyone inspecting the frontend source could extract the key
- Using this key, the encrypted data could be decrypted locally


Impact Assessment

Risk Level: High  
Affected Data: User mobile numbers (PII)

Potential abuse scenarios include:
- Privacy violations
- Mass data harvesting
- Chaining with XSS or token leakage
- Bypassing UI-level data masking

 Disclosure Outcome

- The issue was responsibly reported with clear reproduction steps
- The organization closed the report as *duplicate*
- No further testing was conducted after confirmation


 Key Learnings

- Encryption alone does not equal security
- Client-side crypto is often a red flag
- Understanding cryptographic design is critical in AppSec
- Duplicate findings are common in mature bug bounty programs

Skills Demonstrated

- Web application security testing
- Client-side JavaScript analysis
- Cryptographic vulnerability identification
- PII protection assessment
- Responsible disclosure practices
