# Case Study: Production Debug Misconfiguration in Automotive Platform


# Overview

During security testing of a public-facing automotive platform used in India,
a server-side security misconfiguration was identified where the application
was running with **debug mode enabled in production**.

This case study documents the finding, validation approach, potential impact,
and responsible disclosure process — without exposing sensitive details.

 Vulnerability Type

- Security Misconfiguration
- Debug Mode Enabled in Production
- Sensitive Information Disclosure

OWASP Top 10: A05 – Security Misconfiguration

Discovery Method

- Manual reconnaissance of unauthenticated endpoints
- Observed abnormal server error behavior on malformed POST requests
- Analyzed HTTP responses for error handling patterns

No authentication bypass or exploitation was performed.

 Proof of Issue (Sanitised)

The server returned a verbose error page containing:

- Confirmation that `DEBUG = True`
- Internal application directory structure
- Framework stack traces
- Backend service configuration references

This information should *never be exposed* in a production environment.

Why This Is a Valid Security Issue

Running production systems with debug enabled can allow attackers to:

- Understand internal application logic
- Map file system paths and frameworks
- Identify technology versions and attack surface
- Craft targeted exploits based on stack traces

While this issue alone does not grant direct access, it significantly lowers
the barrier for further attacks*

 Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Information Disclosure → Attack Surface Expansion

This type of issue is commonly chained with other vulnerabilities such as:
- IDOR
- Auth bypass
- Deserialization flaws
- Known framework CVEs

 Responsible Disclosure

- No data modification was attempted
- No user information was accessed
- Findings were responsibly reported to the organization
- Only minimal proof-of-concept evidence was shared

Key Learnings

- Debug misconfigurations remain common in large production systems
- Error handling behavior is a critical recon signal
- High-quality reporting matters more than exploitation
- Responsible disclosure builds credibility

Skills Demonstrated

- Web application security testing
- Django framework behavior analysis
- Security misconfiguration identification
- Evidence-driven vulnerability reporting
- Ethical disclosure practices
